The function opens the thumbnail image from the specified path in binary mode and saves it to the 'thumbnail' field of the video instance using Django's File API.

### def convert_resolution(source, width):
Convert a video file to a lower resolution.    
Takes a file path to a video file and a target width in pixels, and saves a converted version of the video to the same directory with "_{width}p" appended to the filename.
   
The conversion is done using ffmpeg, with the following options:    
    - Input: the source video file
    - Video filter: scale the video to the target width, keeping the aspect ratio
    - Video codec: libx264
    - Constant rate factor: 23
    - Audio codec: copy the audio from the source file (no re-encoding)

### def get_video_duration(video_path):

    **Returns:**    
      - float

        - output_folder (str): Path to the folder to store the generated HLS segments.
        - resolution (str): Target resolution for the video. Supported values are '480', '720', '1080'.
    **Returns:**
        - str: Path to the generated HLS manifest file.
    **Raises:**
